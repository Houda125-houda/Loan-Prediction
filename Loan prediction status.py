###############################################

# we are going to predict whether a person is eligible for a loan or not 
# let's start :) 
# we consider one finance company that gives loan for people so before approving the loan  this company analyzes various credential of the person 
# se there are several aspects whether the person is educated, graduated or not , married or single so many parameters so this company wants to automate this loan approval process
# so what happend, the person fill an online application form and based on the information given by the user we need to develop a machine learninh system that can tell the company of this person is elegiblefor this loan or not 


# we are going to use the SVM support vector mOdel which is a supervised learning model ==>  we will give the data which has labels one is : loan approved and the second is rejected


# import the dependencies = functions and librairies 
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np 
import seaborn as sns # plot librairy
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score # it's used to evaluate our model it tells how well our model is perfoming on a given dataset 


# loading the data set 
Loan_data = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/LENOVO/Documents/GitHub/Loan-Prediction/dataset_loan.csv")
# copy 
# df = Loan_data.copy()
# Loan_data.info() ===> for types of data have to verify this ^^
type(Loan_data)  # the type of data   == > pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
Loan_data.head()
# the numbre of rows and column 
Loan_data.dtypes
Loan_data.shape
# statistical measures 
Loan_data.describe()
Loan_data["Property_Area"].value_counts()
# The number of missing values 
Loan_data.isna().sum()  # Loan_data.isnull().sum()  ===> in this case we dont have much
