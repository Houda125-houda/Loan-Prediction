# we are going to predict whether a person is eligible for a loan or not 
# let's start :) 
# we consider one finance company that gives loan for people so before approving the loan  this company analyzes various credential of the person 
# se there are several aspects whether the person is educated, graduated or not , married or single so many parameters so this company wants to automate this loan approval process
# so what happend, the person fill an online application form and based on the information given by the user we need to develop a machine learninh system that can tell the company of this person is elegiblefor this loan or not 


# we are going to use the SVM support vector mOdel which is a supervised learning model ==>  we will give the data which has labels one is : loan approved and the second is rejected
